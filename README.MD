# Just Breathe

## Description
An application that uses third-party API:"Air Visual" and "Climacell", to display air quality index, pollen count and temperature for a given city.

## Motivation for development
Given the current situation with global warming, the level of air quality is getting worse, pollution and pollen allergies are getting worse. We wanted to create an application to help people with respitory concerns, that wants to plan their day outside, and check if their city has a good air quality and types of pollen count.  
We also included the posibility to search for other cities information and gave our users the chance to know what are those indexes before move or travel to other cities. This page is good for everyone even if they don't know much about what those indexes are we have two different references table for them to check the differnts levels of Air Quality and Pollent Count.

## Features
* When users open the application the page display Air quality, Pollen count types and temperaure for current location.
